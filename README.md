# Speech to Speech Machine Translation: Tutorial

This repository contains material for the ICON 2021 tutorial on _Speech to Speech Machine Translation_

## Summary
Speech to Speech Machine Translation (SSMT) is a task of translating a speech that belongs to a source language into a speech belonging to some other language, i.e. target language. A popular approach to this task is to break down the SSMT system into different independent sub-components which are Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Machine Translation (MT), and Text To Speech synthesis (TTS). Each of these sub-components has been studied for a long period of time, and several approaches for each sub-component can be seen in the literature. The focus of this tutorial is to cover the breadth of the literature on recent advances in ASR, MT, TTS along with Disfluency Corection (DC) and Automatic Post Editing (APE) and to show how the ASR-DC-MT-APE-TTS pipeline leads to the cascaded SSMT. The tutorial will help the audience in getting started with the SSMT as a whole. The tutorial will also provide good insights into ASR, DC, MT, APE, and TTS as individual concepts.
